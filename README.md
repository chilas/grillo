![alt text](img/grillo-logo.png "Logo")

Grillo is a front-end framework for developing web applications with a defined structure for organizing the various components that make up the project.

By calling it a front-end framework, it is not only just a framework containing HTML, CSS and JS files, but also one with a predefined set of tasks that are run by the [Grunt build system](http://gruntjs.com/). Grillo combines parts of frameworks, patterns and best practices to form a complete structure for creating web applications.
